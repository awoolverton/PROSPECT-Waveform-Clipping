# PROSPECT-Waveform-Clipping
This repository outlines the clipping problem within the PROSPECT analysis when a particle event exceeds the signal limitations of the photomultiplying tubes. Through a series of Jupyter Notebooks, this repository attempts to construct a map between the time offset and the clipped pulse shaped discrimination figure of merit.
